RACC FAQs – Quick Answers to Get You Started
1. What is RACC?
The Responsibly Armed Citizen Criterion is Apache Solutions’ 4-phase, belt-style
progression system for civilian concealed carry—starting with safety &
marksmanship and advancing to refined control & real-world competency. Every
skill is pressure-tested with live-fire benchmarks, a written exam, and
competency checks.
2. How long does it take to complete?
No set timeline—you advance when you’re ready. We can say that the full RACC
program typically takes 12–24 months, depending on your schedule and goals. It
is not designed to be something that someone can just walk in and complete.
The real benefit is in the process. So, come into this with a process focus, and
the results will come.
3. Do I need prior experience?
No. You don’t even need any gear! Sometimes, we prefer it that way. RACC
starts at zero. Whether you’ve never held a gun or you’re a seasoned carrier,
your trainer meets you exactly where you are.
4. What do I need for the first session? A valid ID, a legal guardian must be
present (if under 18), and a positive attitude!
5. How much does it cost?
Private sessions are $60/hour or $100/2-hours for the first 10 sessions. Rate
drops to $50/$90 after your first 10 sessions. Pay per session—or take
advantage of our end-of-the-year deals for a significant discount.
6. Can I use my own gun and holster?
Yes—bring what you carry. We’ll assess fit, safety, and function. If you don’t have
gear yet, please do not rush out and buy things; we’ll guide you through the
process.
7. Is this just for concealed carry permits?
No. This is not a “concealed carry permit” class. RACC goes beyond permit
classes. It builds lifelong proficiency, not just a certificate. (Permit training can be
added if needed.)
8. What if I miss a week or two?
No problem! Sessions are 100% flexible—book when it works for you. Progress
is tracked per phase, not calendar. We do ask students to retest on the previous
phase if they have been absent for longer than 90 days.
9. Will I shoot on day one?
Only if you’re ready. Phase 1 begins with safety, handling, and dry practice—live
fire training comes after both you and your trainer feel that you are ready.
10. How do I know I’m improving?
Every phase ends with objective benchmarks:
✅ Apache B-8 scores
✅ Timed drills
✅ Skill demos (reloads, malfunctions, one-hand shooting)
You’ll see data-driven proof of progress.
