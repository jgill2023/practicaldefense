Integrate our existing Printify store into this Replit web application using the Printify API, so products can be browsed, selected, and ordered directly within the app while fulfillment is handled by Printify.

This integration must be:

API-driven (not iframe-only unless used as fallback)

Brand-consistent with the existing app

Secure and scalable

Ready for production use

🔐 Environment & Secrets Setup

Use Replit Secrets for all credentials:

PRINTIFY_API_KEY

PRINTIFY_STORE_ID

(Optional) STRIPE_SECRET_KEY if using custom checkout

(Optional) STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY

Do NOT hardcode credentials.

🧠 Core Functional Requirements
1️⃣ Product Sync

Fetch products from Printify via API:

Product name

Description

Images

Variants (size, color, price)

Availability

Cache results to reduce API calls

Gracefully handle out-of-stock variants

2️⃣ Storefront UI

Create a storefront inside the app with:

Product grid

Product detail page

Variant selector (size/color)

Quantity selector

Add-to-cart functionality

UI should match the app’s existing theme (action-comic / tactical professional styling).

3️⃣ Cart & Checkout Flow (Two Supported Modes)
✅ Mode A: Printify-Hosted Checkout (Fastest)

Add items to cart

Redirect user to Printify checkout

Pass selected variants and quantities

Maintain branding consistency where possible

✅ Mode B: Custom Checkout (Preferred)

Collect customer info inside the app

Process payment via Stripe

Create order in Printify via API

Send confirmation email

Handle errors and retries

Implement whichever mode fits best with existing payment infrastructure.

4️⃣ Order Creation

When an order is submitted:

Create a Printify order via API

Include:

Customer shipping info

Selected variants

Quantity

Support:

Automatic fulfillment

Manual approval (configurable)

5️⃣ Order Status & Confirmation

Store order metadata locally (order ID, status)

Display confirmation screen

Send confirmation email

Optionally poll Printify for order status updates

🧱 Technical Implementation Notes

Create a Printify service module (e.g. printifyService.ts)

Abstract API calls:

getProducts()

getProductById()

createOrder()

Handle API rate limits

Validate inputs before order submission

🔒 Security & Compliance

Never expose Printify API key to the client

All Printify calls must be server-side

Sanitize user input

Validate shipping addresses

🧪 Error Handling

Graceful fallback if Printify API is unavailable

Clear user-facing error messages

Log failures for debugging

🚫 Do NOT:

Hardcode credentials

Bypass payment verification

Modify unrelated business logic

Use deprecated Printify endpoints

✅ Deliverables

Printify API integration complete

Storefront UI embedded in the app

Secure order creation flow

Cart + checkout working

Ready for production testing

🎯 Final Outcome

Users should be able to:

Browse merch inside the app

Select variants

Checkout cleanly

Receive products fulfilled by Printify
…without ever feeling like they left your platform.
