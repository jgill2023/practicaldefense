1. Overview

At Practical Defense Training, LLC (“we,” “us,” or “our”), we understand that plans can change. Because class sizes are limited and range time is reserved in advance, we have established the following refund and cancellation policy to ensure fairness to all students and instructors.

By registering for a course on www.abqconcealedcarry.com
, you acknowledge and agree to the terms below.

2. Student Cancellations
Cancellations More Than 21 Days Before Class Start

Students who cancel more than 21 calendar days prior to the first day of class are eligible for a full refund.

Refunds will be processed to the original payment method, and any Stripe processing fees will be covered by us.

Cancellations Within 14–21 Days of Class Start

Students who cancel within 14 to 21 calendar days of the first day of class are not eligible for a refund, but may apply 100% of the payment toward a future course within 12 calendar months of the original class date.

Cancellations With Less Than 14 Days’ Notice

Cancellations made less than 14 calendar days before the first day of class will forfeit the deposit but may apply any payment made beyond the deposit toward a future course within 12 calendar months.

Example:
If a course has a $165 enrollment fee and a $50 deposit, and a student cancels within 14 days of the class after paying in full, the $50 deposit will be forfeited, but the $115 remaining balance may be applied to a future class within 12 months.

Emergencies and exceptional circumstances (e.g., illness, family emergency, military deployment) will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Supporting documentation may be requested.
