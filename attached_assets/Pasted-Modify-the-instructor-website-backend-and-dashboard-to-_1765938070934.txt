Modify the instructor website backend and dashboard to support
Google Calendar busy-event visibility for instructors/admins ONLY,
while continuing to hide these events from students and public users.

CONTEXT
- Google OAuth and tokens are already handled by auth.instructorops.com
- OAuth tokens are stored server-side and keyed ONLY by instructorId
- This app already fetches available booking slots via:
  GET /api/appointments/available-slots
- Google Calendar blocking is already required for availability logic

GOALS
1. Block availability for students/public users based on Google Calendar busy times
2. Display Google Calendar booked/busy events inside the instructor/admin dashboard
3. Ensure Google Calendar events are NEVER exposed to students or unauthenticated users

ROLE & ACCESS RULES
- Visible Google Calendar events:
  ✔️ INSTRUCTOR
  ✔️ ADMIN
  ✔️ SUPERADMIN
- Hidden Google Calendar events:
  ❌ STUDENT
  ❌ PUBLIC / UNAUTHENTICATED USERS
- Public booking pages should ONLY see filtered availability, never raw events

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

A) SERVER-SIDE GOOGLE CALENDAR FETCH
- Add a server-only service that:
  - Uses instructorId to load Google OAuth tokens
  - Fetches Google Calendar events using:
    calendar.events.list
    with:
      - timeMin / timeMax (current view range)
      - singleEvents: true
      - orderBy: "startTime"
- Normalize returned events into:
  {
    id,
    title,
    startTime,
    endTime,
    source: "google",
    calendarId
  }

B) AVAILABILITY FILTERING (STUDENTS / PUBLIC)
- Continue using Google Calendar busy times to REMOVE conflicting slots
- Do NOT expose event titles, descriptions, or calendar names
- Availability API should return ONLY free slots

C) DASHBOARD EVENTS API (INSTRUCTORS / ADMINS ONLY)
- Add a new endpoint:
  GET /api/instructor/calendar/events
- Protect it with role-based authorization:
  - instructor, admin, superadmin ONLY
- Response should include:
  - Google Calendar events
  - Internal bookings (if applicable)
  - Clearly mark event source ("google" vs "internal")

D) FRONTEND DASHBOARD DISPLAY
- In instructor/admin dashboard:
  - Display Google Calendar events in a read-only list or calendar view
  - Label them clearly as:
    "Google Calendar (External)"
- Do NOT allow editing or deletion of Google Calendar events from this UI

E) SECURITY & SEPARATION
- Do NOT reuse student-facing endpoints for Google Calendar events
- Do NOT include Google Calendar data in:
  - /available-slots
  - public booking pages
  - student APIs
- Ensure all Google Calendar access happens server-side only

F) LOGGING (TEMPORARY)
Add logs to confirm correct behavior:
- [Google Events Fetch] instructorId, eventsCount
- [Availability Filter] slotsRemovedDueToGoogle
- [Dashboard Access] role, instructorId

EXPECTED RESULTS
- Students only see available time slots (Google Calendar conflicts removed)
- Instructors/admins see their booked Google Calendar events in the dashboard
- No Google Calendar event data leaks to public or student users
