🟦 REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATION
1️⃣ Stripe Account Onboarding (Single Business)

Implement a “Connect Stripe” flow so Apache Solutions can:

Connect an existing Stripe account, OR

Create a new Stripe account during onboarding

This should use Stripe’s standard account onboarding, not Connect payouts.

Stripe handles:

Bank account setup

Identity verification

Tax information

PCI compliance

2️⃣ Configuration

Store securely:

Stripe Secret Key

Stripe Publishable Key

No Stripe Client ID is required.

3️⃣ Connect Stripe Flow

Add endpoint:

POST /api/stripe/onboard


Behavior:

Redirect Apache Solutions admin to Stripe’s hosted onboarding

On completion, confirm Stripe account is enabled for charges and payouts

Store a simple boolean flag: stripeEnabled = true

⚠️ No Stripe account ID needs to be stored for Connect purposes.

4️⃣ Payment Processing (Direct Payments Only)

All payments are processed directly under Apache Solutions’ Stripe account:

stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount,
  currency: "usd",
  automatic_payment_methods: { enabled: true }
});


Results:

Apache Solutions receives funds directly

Daily payouts are controlled in Stripe Dashboard

Stripe receipts are branded as Apache Solutions

5️⃣ Refunds

Refunds are handled by Apache Solutions:

Via Stripe Dashboard, OR

Via API:

stripe.refunds.create({
  payment_intent: paymentIntentId
});


Refund emails and confirmations are branded as Apache Solutions.

6️⃣ Branding

Stripe branding settings are configured in:

Stripe Dashboard → Settings → Branding

Business name: Apache Solutions, LLC

Logo: Apache Solutions logo

Support email: Apache Solutions support email

Statement descriptor: APACHESOLUTIONS

Customers will only ever see Apache Solutions.
