According to the announcement, "the Department of Public Safety will no longer be providing the online training for two year refreshers."</p>

<p>We do not support this decision, despite recognizing some instructors may approve. In response, we have relaunched our own online refresher option.</p>

<p>Students completing our online refresher course must still complete an in-person qualification shoot. We have reached out to DPS to determine if students from our online program can bypass that shooting requirement, as it was previously approved.</p>

<p>The online refresher course requires approximately two hours to complete. Students then select from our available range sessions to complete their qualification.</p>

<h2>What DPS Said</h2>

<p>The Department emphasized: "We have some of the best trainers in the country here in New Mexico, who are already approved, and very capable of providing the type of training our permit holders have come to expect."</p>

<h2>Refresher Course Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Two-year refreshers must occur between 22-26 months of your license issue date</li>
<li>Military, law enforcement, and certain veterans are exempt</li>
<li>Courses must be two hours with qualification shooting in permitted calibers</li>
<li>Instructors determine curriculum content within DPS guidelines</li>

    content: `<h2>In 3 Easy Steps</h2>

<p>Getting your New Mexico Concealed Carry License (NM CCL or NMCCL) is a fairly straightforward process, and isn't as difficult as some would think. In fact, you can complete most of the required training online. We'll discuss that more a little further in this guide.</p>

<p>Before we get into the steps, let's address why you're here. You've probably heard the common reasons — crime rates, slow police response times. But the deeper reason is personal: Your life is too important and you mean so much to your loved ones, that you cannot afford to bet your life on the mercy of someone who is willing to violently attack you or your loved ones.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Complete an Approved NM Concealed Carry Course</h2>

<p>Complete an approved New Mexico Department of Public Safety concealed carry course. You can take this in-person over a weekend, or complete most of the coursework online at your own pace through our Online NM Concealed Carry Course. We have over 100 five-star ratings across Google and Facebook.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Register for Electronic Fingerprinting</h2>

<p>Register with Cogent ID for electronic fingerprinting, which is required for your background check. The fingerprinting fee is $44 and is separate from the course cost.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Submit Your Application to NM DPS</h2>

<p>Submit your completed application to the New Mexico Department of Public Safety along with your certificate of completion, fingerprint receipt, and required documents.</p>

<h2>Already Have Your License?</h2>

<p>If you already have your NM CCL, don't forget about your 2-year refresher course and 4-year renewal requirements. We offer reminders to help you stay current with your license.</p>`,

    content: `<p>Pretend for a moment that you're the guy in the blue jeans, button-down shirt, and cowboy hat. Caught completely off guard with his back to the door, and panicked. His life went from calm and peaceful to turmoil in a matter of seconds. What would you do?</p>

<p>Two threats emerge — one brandishing a handgun — forcing you to scramble for cover behind the nearest display. The armed robber dives through the counter window, shooting at cashiers who frantically escape incoming rounds. When he notices you, he takes aim but diverts attention back to the cashiers. One cashier retrieves a hidden handgun and returns fire. The second attacker, having been shot at, flees through the exit.</p>

<p>What would you have done, assuming that you had your concealed handgun on your person? When would you have acted? Would you have acted?</p>

<h2>What Would I Have Done?</h2>

<p>Without prior planning, panic and scrambling would likely occur — the same reaction as the man in the cowboy hat. This underscores why remaining aware of your surroundings, at all times, matters for those rare critical moments.</p>

<h2>What Would I Have Done Differently?</h2>

<p>The man's back faced the door, appearing unaware of his surroundings. Those familiar with Cooper's Color Codes recognize he was in "condition White." Better positioning — seeing the door while conducting business — wouldn't guarantee victory but might provide a few extra milliseconds to react, allowing yourself to get behind cover and draw your handgun without it being noticed.</p>

<h2>When Would I Have Acted?</h2>

<p>Analyzing the video timeline, approximately 18 seconds was optimal: enough time to observe what was going on, orient myself, decide what to do, and act. With range experience presenting from concealment in 1.2 seconds at 7 yards, real-world response under ambush would be slower but feasible in under a second and a half.</p>

<h2>What Did We Learn?</h2>

<p><strong>PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR SURROUNDINGS.</strong> If you had 5 seconds to observe a threat, would you be able to execute?</p>

<p>Mental preparation — envisioning such encounters beforehand — gives your brain a slight head-start versus experiencing this unprepared. Decrease your response time through training while increasing your decision time through situational awareness.</p>`,

    content: `<p>Before I get into it, I wanted to say Thank You to Rick Davis of Deliberate Defense for hosting Andrew Branca, as well as Andrew Branca for making the trip to Albuquerque to share, not only his knowledge, but also his expertise, on the Law of Self Defense.</p>

<p>The seminar began on schedule and delivered substantial content. Attendance included approximately 12 people comprising concealed carry instructors, two attorneys, and several concealed carry permit holders. We were forewarned about receiving extensive legal information regarding lawful force use — potentially exceeding what most attorneys receive in education or what patrol officers learn during academy training.</p>

<p>I purchased the bound slide materials for twenty dollars — an investment well worth it. Several unprepared attendees purchased slides during breaks. Approximately 350 slides contained substantive material without filler content. The seminar ran from 1:00 PM to approximately 6:30 PM with minimal five-minute breaks.</p>

<p>Branca delivered information at a deliberate pace without wasting words, and audience questions were typically answered within a few slides. He effectively communicated New Mexico-specific law to general concealed carry permit holders despite traveling every weekend for presentations.</p>

<p>The seminar cost $150 regular admission or $100 for early registration — an exceptional value. As a New Mexico concealed carry licensing instructor with above-average legal understanding, I gained knowledge exceeding the seminar cost.</p>

<p>Branca successfully translated legal terminology into accessible language — an art form. The five-and-a-half-hour event felt considerably shorter.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend attendance and suggest saving $10 biweekly until Branca returns to schedule attendance. The seminar potentially prevents costly legal mistakes or saves consultation fees with Branca (noted as $450 for initial consultation following deadly force incidents).</p>`,

    content: `<p>Carrying a gun doesn't make you safe, no more than wearing a seat belt prevents an auto accident. It's your <em>Plan B</em>. Plan A is to <strong>NOT</strong> get into an auto accident (violent confrontation). It is when we gain this false sense of security or safety, and at times — ignorant sense of invincibility — that we allow ourselves to become complacent. Complacency is dangerous.</p>

<p>The complacent driver doesn't check their blind spots, doesn't yield at an intersection, and doesn't know what's going on on the roadway around them.</p>

<p>The complacent victim will enter the gas station that their gut tells them not to, will not notice the man who is keyed in on him/her, and will verbally engage and argue with the hostile guy in the parking lot. The complacent victim listens to his/her ego over his or her intuition and ignorantly believes that they are safe because they have their handgun within an arm's reach.</p>

<p>These are all dangerous beliefs and patterns of thought. If we thought seat belts prevented auto accidents, we would all drive twice as fast and make twice as many poor driving decisions. We would never use our blinker or check our blind spots. We would do this because our seat belts were magical and would keep us from getting into an accident, so why bother with that responsible and safe driving stuff?!</p>

<p>The truth is we don't count on the seat belt to prevent an accident, we realize that it is our last ditch hope at increasing our odds of surviving an accident with the understanding that a seat belt won't necessarily save our life.</p>

<h2>How Do We Stay Safe While Carrying?</h2>

<p>For starters, pretend that you don't have it on your person — if you wouldn't go there unarmed, don't go there. If you wouldn't argue with the guy in the parking lot unarmed, don't argue with him — <strong>especially if you're armed</strong>. We do our best to avoid an auto accident. The key is that we are an active participant in this avoidance.</p>

<p>We are aware of the remote possibility and plan its prevention through safe driving practices. <em>Do we practice this same level of alertness and awareness in our day-to-day lives?</em> Are we aware of those potential risks when we are not driving? Do you truly know what normal looks like in your day-to-day life and are you able to recognize when something is <strong>not</strong> normal? Have you considered how you would react and what you would do if you became the victim of a violent confrontation?</p>

<p>Your concealed handgun is not a force-field. Like the seat belt, it is there as a means to increase your odds of survival should you ever find yourself in a life-threatening, self-defense encounter. There are no guarantees of life or death and there is no better or more sobering testament to this than the many lives of good men and women who have fallen to evil's hand.</p>

<p>All we can do is prepare for the rare dance with evil that we may one day face and do our best to avoid it at all costs. We can increase our chances of winning and making it home to our loved ones, while never completely eliminating the risk of death. That is the harsh reality — carrying a gun does not make you safe.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is, our safety and protection, and the safety and protection of our loved ones, is our responsibility. We must recognize that a handgun is a great self-defense tool, but that it will not guarantee our survival in a life-threatening, self-defense encounter. Similar to always wearing your seat belt, you must always carry your handgun — we do not get to choose if or when we will become the victim of a violent attack — only whether or not we will be prepared to fight and survive.</p>

<p><strong>Carry all the time, and all the time, carry.</strong></p>`,

    content: `<h2>How to Get Your Active Duty Concealed Carry License</h2>

<p>Recent legislative changes exempt military members from New Mexico concealed carry course requirements and the $56 application fee. We at Practical Defense Training promote these modifications as beneficial for gun owners' rights.</p>

<p>Key requirement update: The NM DPS will require members of the military to show proof of handgun caliber and type (semi-auto or revolver) qualification.</p>

<h2>Step One: Print and Complete the Necessary Forms</h2>

<p>Go to the New Mexico Department of Public Safety website and print three forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Applicant Application for NM Concealed Carry License</li>
<li>Authorization For Release of Information (must be completed before a notary public)</li>
<li>Authorization To Obtain Health Information (witness signature required)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step Two: Gather Other Necessary Documents</h2>

<p>Required documents include:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Mexico Driver's License or Photo ID</li>
<li>Original or certified birth certificate</li>
<li>DD214 or proof of active duty status</li>
<li>Proof of handgun qualification</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step Three: Register for Fingerprints</h2>

<p>Register through CogentID and attend a fingerprinting facility to have your electronic fingerprints taken.</p>

<h2>Step Four: Submit Your Application</h2>

<p>Physical submission to the NM DPS office (Third Floor) is recommended over mailing.</p>

<h2>Step Five: Wait</h2>

<p>Processing timeframe is typically 60 or 90 days, however, most of our students have been receiving their CCL in a few weeks.</p>

<h2>A Note on Training</h2>

<p>While military members are exempt from the course requirement, they may lack instruction in New Mexico-specific concealed carry topics. We offer a discounted military course to fill this gap, with proceeds donated to veterans' nonprofits.</p>

    content: `<p>We've been asked several times about our new payment option, "Deferred Payment", and decided to create a short post detailing what it's all about.</p>

<p>Previously, if a student wanted to take a concealed carry course they would have to find a course and instructor that fit their schedule and budget, then roll the dice on whether the course would be worthwhile — after having already paid. The incentive for the course to challenge and engage students is minimal as the course has already been bought and paid for by the student. That is the main reason we offer FREE Concealed Carry Re-Training for those students who may have taken a concealed carry course from another instructor and were not satisfied with the training they received.</p>

<h2>How Our Deferred Payment Option Works</h2>

<p>A student will choose one of our courses that best fits their schedule and choose to enroll. The student selects the "Deferred Payment" ticket, completes the student registration form, and pays the $50 initial payment. This secures the student's spot in the chosen course.</p>

<p>The student takes the course, and when satisfied with the course and wishes to receive the certificate of completion, they can choose to pay the remaining balance in full at the end of the class or choose to pay the remaining balance over several payments (within 60 days of completing the course).</p>

<h2>The Breakdown</h2>

<ol>
<li>The student chooses the course they wish to take</li>
<li>The student chooses the "Deferred Payment" option, making a nominal initial payment of $50</li>
<li>The student takes the course and upon completing it can either:
  <ul>
  <li>Pay the remaining balance in full, or</li>
  <li>Elect to pay the remaining balance at their convenience within 60 days</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Once the remaining balance has been paid off, the student will receive the certificate of completion needed to apply for and obtain a NM Concealed Carry License</li>
</ol>

<p>Please call us, or shoot us a text, if you have any questions: (505) 944-5247</p>

<h2>The Fine Print</h2>

<p>The remaining balance must be paid in full within 60 days or monies paid will be applied to a subsequent concealed carry course. The deferred payment option is not valid with promotions or coupons. That's it, pretty simple and straightforward.</p>

<p>So, what are you waiting for?! Enroll in our next course today!</p>`,

<h2>How a Traditional Course Is Conducted</h2>

<p>Students arrive nervous and eager. The course starts with introductions and preliminary questions, progressing to lectures and discussions comprising most of the instruction. After completing firearms safety classroom content, students move to the live-fire range to shoot a prescribed qualification drill, then return for additional classroom lectures.</p>

<h2>How Our Online Course Is Conducted</h2>

<p>Students enroll and immediately begin, regardless of schedule or location. The course includes student introduction forum posts, online video lectures, training videos, discussions, quizzes, and assignments. Upon completing the online portion, students schedule a live-fire range session to develop practical defensive handgun skills and demonstrate their knowledge of presented topics.</p>

<h2>Can It Work?</h2>

<p>Yes, absolutely, and it already has. Many collegiate and accredited degree programs are conducted online. Our online course allows you to complete the majority of the coursework online at your own pace and place, then attend a hands-on range session for the practical component.</p>`,

    content: `<p>You've narrowed your choice of concealed carry instructors and their courses down to a handful or so. Now it's time to reach out to those instructors and ask them a few questions. We've put together the 5 must-ask questions that you should ask any concealed carry instructor that you are considering to train under.</p>

<h2>1. Why Do You Teach NM Concealed Carry?</h2>

<p>You'll want to get an insight into why they have chosen to teach concealed carry. You should expect to receive an answer inline with an urge, calling, or want to add more legally and responsibly armed citizens to their community. Listen for their tone and sincerity when they speak. Do they seem genuine when answering this question, or did their answer seem forced or rehearsed? Steer clear of those instructors who don't have an answer or seem unsure of why they teach concealed carry.</p>

<h2>2. What Is The Most Important Lesson That You Teach?</h2>

<p>The typical New Mexico Concealed Carry Course will cover roughly 12–15 topics. While each lesson is important, some will be more critical than others. With this question you're looking for a passionate response — genuine and natural, not rehearsed or forced. Any answer that seems superficial should be challenged with follow-up questions about why that topic matters to the student and how it can affect their life.</p>

<h2>3. What Is The Best Caliber For Self-Defense?</h2>

<p>Any answer other than something similar to "the best caliber for self-defense is going to be relative to the shooter..." is cause for concern. The best caliber for self-defense is the largest caliber that the shooter is comfortable, confident, and proficient with. You cannot miss fast enough with a .45 to stop a threat, and while a .22 caliber handgun may not immediately stop the threat, defensively accurate hits on the intended threat is more important than the caliber.</p>

<h2>4. Can I Get In Touch With Any Of Your Previous Students?</h2>

<p>If an instructor is reluctant to allow you to speak to previous students, or would prefer that you didn't, it should be a big red flag. Try to seek out students that weren't specifically mentioned by the instructor. Post a request on the instructor's Facebook page seeking previous students, and ask that they contact you privately for an anonymous conversation.</p>

<h2>5. Why Should I Train With You?</h2>

<p>And just listen. Trust your gut. Give us a call if you have any questions: (505) 944-5247</p>`,

<h2>Step 1: Find an Approved Concealed Carry Course</h2>

<p>There are many concealed carry courses that happen each month, and many instructors. There are fewer that are worth your hard-earned time and money. You'll want to find a course that fits within your budget, schedule, and most importantly, expectations. At minimum, all New Mexico Concealed Carry Courses must be no less than 15 hours in length.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Enroll and Take the Course</h2>

<p>Now that you have found a course that meets your standards and is approved by the NM DPS, enroll. Two simple questions: Can you afford the course, and do you want to get your NM CCL? If you answered yes to both, stop procrastinating. You're busy, but you won't be any less busy — take the course so you'll be better able to protect yourself and your loved ones.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Complete the Two-Page Application</h2>

<p>Fill out the two-page application for a New Mexico Concealed Carry License. We walk students through this step during our courses so you have someone to help with any questions.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Get Fingerprinted and Notarized</h2>

<p>New Mexico requires electronic fingerprints through Cogent ID. Register at cogentid.com, then visit the nearest fingerprinting location. While you're there, have them notarize your Information Release Form — it's one less stop on your way to getting your NM CCL.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Gather Your Documents</h2>

<p>You'll need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete, Two-Page Application</li>
<li>$56 Application Fee</li>
<li>New Mexico Driver's License or ID</li>
<li>Original (or Certified Copy) Birth Certificate</li>
<li>Certificate of Completion of a Concealed Carry Training Course</li>
<li>Two Authorization Release Forms (Health and Information)</li>
<li>Electronic Fingerprints</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 6: Submit to NM Department of Public Safety</h2>

<p>Take your completed application, all documents, and the $56 application fee to:</p>

<p>NM Department of Public Safety<br/>
Concealed Carry Unit<br/>
6301 Indian School Rd. NE, Suite 310<br/>
Albuquerque, NM 87110</p>

<p>We recommend dropping it off in person — they're located on the third floor. They'll give your application a quick glance to ensure everything is completed correctly.</p>`,

    content: `<p>You've been wanting and waiting to get your New Mexico Concealed Carry License for quite some time, and now you've begun trying to find an appropriate concealed carry course and instructor. We've been there and probably had the same questions that you're having now.</p>

<h2>Make Sure They're "Legit"</h2>

<p>The concealed carry instructor has to be approved by the New Mexico Department of Public Safety and the course itself must be approved by the same folks at NM DPS. The easiest way to verify is to check the approved list of concealed carry instructors on the NM DPS website.</p>

<h2>Read Their Reviews</h2>

<p>See if their website has a testimonial section, or if they have received any reviews on Google. Check their Facebook page. Post a request asking previous students for their opinion. If they delete your request, that should be a red flag. Call the instructor and have a conversation with them.</p>

<h2>Check Out Their Images/Videos</h2>

<p>Do the students look engaged and having an enjoyable time? Do you notice any safety concerns? What are the instructors doing?</p>

<h2>Does the Course Fit Your Schedule?</h2>

<p>Typically, concealed carry courses are held on a Saturday and Sunday, from 9:00 to 5:00. Some are stretched over 3 five-hour days. Another option that is gaining popularity is an Online Concealed Carry Course, which allows you to complete the majority of the coursework at your own pace.</p>

<h2>Does It Fit Your Needs and Expectations?</h2>

<p>The best instructor is relative to the student. We pride ourselves on being able to take the student who has never shot a handgun before and getting them confident, comfortable, and proficient in the 15 short hours we have with them. Our courses are designed for beginning to intermediate shooters.</p>

<h2>Does the Course Meet the Requisite Hours?</h2>

<p>There are a few instructors happy to skirt the 15-hour requirement. Sure, you'll get the certificate, but once these instructors have their credentials revoked, their students will have their concealed carry licenses revoked as well.</p>

<h2>What Type of Hands-On Training Will You Receive?</h2>

<p>New Mexico doesn't require hands-on training beyond the qualification shoot. Look for a course that offers more — we recommend a minimum of 100 rounds. Any course that does not train the student on how to present the handgun from concealment should not be considered a concealed carry course.</p>

<h2>The Skinny</h2>

<p>Here's what to look for:</p>
<ol>
<li>The instructor and course are approved by NM DPS</li>
<li>Positive reviews with access to previous students</li>
<li>Students appear engaged and safe in photos/videos</li>
<li>A schedule that works for you (including online options)</li>
<li>The course matches your lifestyle and expectations</li>
<li>Meets New Mexico's required 15 hours of instruction</li>
<li>Includes hands-on training in drawing from concealment, grip, stance, trigger control, and shooting more than 25 rounds</li>
</ol>`,
